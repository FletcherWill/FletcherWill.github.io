<h3 id="course-description">Course Description</h3>

<p>Graphs are one of the most powerful and flexible algorithmic tools. Likewise, graph algorithms remains a primary focus of modern algorithms research. This course will sample major results from contemporary paradigms of graph algorithms. Particular attention will be paid to techniques in graph sparsification and how these techniques have helped to recently solve open problems in algorithms. Planned topics include: metric embeddings, expander decompositions, iterative rounding, edge-degree constrained subgraphs and palette sparsification.</p>

<p>This course is aimed at current and potential future graduate students considering proof-based research in algorithms. Each student will be responsible for reading and presenting a paper with the goal of better understanding how contemporary research in theoretical computer science is both done and best communicated.</p>

<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong></p>

<p>The only official pre-requisites for the class is either <a href="https://brown-cs1570.github.io/">CSCI1570</a> or <a href="https://cs.brown.edu/courses/cs155/">CSCI1550</a> (<a href="https://cs.brown.edu/courses/csci1450/">CSCI1450</a> also works).</p>

<p>That said, you should be “mathematically mature” and have experience with formal proofs. Ideally, you have some background in and comfort with proof-based algorithm design and analysis. A strong background in probability will also be helpful for many of the papers.</p>

<p>If you’re unsure if you have an appropriate background feel free to reach out and we can discuss!</p>

<h3 id="logistics">Logistics</h3>
<p>Each student (or pair of students) will be assigned one of the below papers. Student pairs will be assigned to the more complicated papers. The below summarizes everything you’ll have to do for this class:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Fill out form of top 3 papers after shopping period</li>
  <li>Read your assigned paper</li>
  <li>Prepare and give your talk on the paper with at least 6 pre-prepared questions for the audience in your talk</li>
  <li>Schedule a time the week before your talk to practice the introduction portion with me (and do so)</li>
  <li>Actively participate in class and give feedback at the end of each talk</li>
</ul>

<p>Here’s a recommended rough breakdown of the timing of your talk:</p>
<ul>
  <li><em>Introduction:</em> ~30 minutes</li>
  <li><em>Break:</em> ~20 minutes</li>
  <li><em>Technical Details:</em> ~60 minutes</li>
  <li><em>Feedback from the Class:</em> ~15 minutes</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="schedule">Schedule</h3>
<p>You should be able to access the papers through the links below using your Brown credentials (let me know if you have trouble). I’ll give the first two lectures and the first student lecture will be on September 20th. You definitely don’t need all the relevant background to read a given paper but in deciding what papers to choose you may find it easier to read papers in which you have some background. Many of these papers have nicely-digested talks or scribe notes summarizing them that I’ve tried to provide where possible.</p>

<p><strong>Some Good Talks</strong></p>

<p>Here are some example talks by people I feel generally give good talks. I’ve tried to choose topics across a variety of areas of algorithms. I haven’t watched all of the below.</p>

<h3 id="accommodations">Accommodations</h3>
<p>If you feel you have a disability that could affect your performance in the course, please contact <a href="https://www.brown.edu/campus-life/support/accessibility-services/">SAS</a> and ask them to contact me. I’ll do whatever I can to support recommended accommodations.</p>

<h3 id="student-well-being">Student Well-Being</h3>

<p>Doing theory is extremely difficult if you aren’t feeling physically and mentally well, included and supported by your peers and mentors or otherwise marginalized.</p>

<p>My hope is that this is a welcoming and inclusive course. If you feel you have been mistreated please feel free to contact me directly or consider reaching out to some of the <a href="https://cs.brown.edu/about/diversity/">student advocates in the department</a>. If you feel you might be the victim of harassment, consider reaching out to the <a href="https://www.brown.edu/about/administration/title-ix/">Brown Title IX Office</a>.</p>

<p>If you feel you are overstretched or otherwise psychologically distressed I encourage you to reach out to <a href="https://caps.brown.edu/">Brown CAPS</a>.
