I am a 3rd year PhD student in the Brown University Computer Science Department advised by [D. Ellis Hershkowitz](https://dhershko.github.io). I am interested in theoretical computer science, especially graph algorithms, metric embeddings, and clustering. Prior to joining Brown, I received my BA from Carleton College and worked as a software engineer at Amazon.
