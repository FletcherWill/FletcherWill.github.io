I am a PhD student in the Brown University Computer Science Department. I'm broadly interested in theoretical computer science but I'm especially keen on graph-theoretic questions in approximation algorithms, online algorithms, distributed algorithms and metric embeddings.

I completed my PhD in computer science in the Carnegie Mellon Computer Science Department. After that, I spent a lovely year as a postdoc in the ETH Zürich Math Department in the Mathematical Optimization Group.

My research is supported by NSF grant [CCF-2403236](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2403236&HistoricalAwards=false).


<!-- where I was very fortunate to be advised by [Bernhard Haeupler](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~haeupler/) and [R. Ravi](http://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/~ravi/) -->
<!-- where I was hosted by the inimitable [Rico Zenklusen](https://math.ethz.ch/ifor/groups/zenklusen_group/rico-zenklusen.html)  -->

If you're a student interested in doing research on algorithms with me, please read [this page](/group.html).

<!-- Fall 2025 I'm organizing *Algorithms Lunch* where Brown students present their own or others' research on algorithms. If you're a Brown student interested in algorithms please stop by! -->

Fall 2025 I'm organizing the [Brown Theory Seminar](https://theoryseminar.cs.brown.edu/) with [Richard Huang](https://richardhuangz.github.io/). If you're a theory researcher in the Boston/Providence area, consider giving a talk!

<!-- During my PhD I spent time visiting [Mohsen Ghaffari](http://people.csail.mit.edu/ghaffari/)'s group (when he was still at ETH Zürich).  -->



<!-- I also spent the summer and fall of 2022 as a visiting researcher at ETH Zürich's Institute of Theoretical Computer Science. -->

<!-- I previously did my undergrad and master's degrees at Brown where I was lucky to be advised by [Michael Littman](https://www.littmania.com/) and [Stefanie Tellex](https://cs.brown.edu/people/stellex/). At Brown I did work in reinforcement learning, an area which still very much interests me. -->
